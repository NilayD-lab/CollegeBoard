College Board sets students up for success. The education we provide, many say,
        has been crucial for many freshman. They feel delighted to hear that they do not have to
        pay for an introductary course they took in highschool.


  During the COVID-19 pandemic we know many of our students would hate to
        miss out on their AP tests. To combat this, we decided to charge students
        to take the test online. In the face of family turmoil, college preperation
        stands strong!


After further burdening our CEO with 1.8 million dollars of your money, we have decided to
        expand our advertising deparments to continue with this trend. We have looked towards
        TikTok to inspire the next generation to invest in their futures throught College Board.





  As a non-profit, our profit margins are very tight--we only made 1 billion dollars of profit in 2020. We
          need support to maintain a fine balance in the quality of education we provide students to prepare them for college success
          and keeping out CEO happy with his earnings.
